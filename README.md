# Util Collections

## Motivation
When we implement codes, we often search for util functions that are already implemented. 
Here, we are going to share util functions that are often used by others.

## Adding Rule
- You should provide a code in folder and short description about the code. 
- Never push on master. We have prohibited direct push on main branch. Use pull request to avoid confusion. 
- After adding an util function, add an item in the list below. 

## Util Functions
- Fixing the seed
